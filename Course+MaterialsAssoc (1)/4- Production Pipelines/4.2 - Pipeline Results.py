# Databricks notebook source
# The code is using the dbutils.fs.ls() function to list all the files in the directory "dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore". The list of files is then displayed using the display() function.


files = dbutils.fs.ls("dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore")
display(files)

# COMMAND ----------

# This Python code snippet is designed to run in a Databricks environment and is used for listing the contents of a specific directory located in the Databricks File System (DBFS). Here is a concise explanation of the code:

# dbutils.fs.ls: This command is part of Databricks utilities (dbutils). The fs module is used for file system operations, and the ls function is used to list the contents of a specified directory. In this case, the directory is "dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/system/events".

# files = dbutils.fs.ls("dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/system/events"): This line executes the ls command on the specified path and stores the result (a list of files and directories present in the given directory) in the variable files.

# display(files): In Databricks notebooks, the display() function is used to show the contents of the variable in a more readable format. In this case, it will visually present the list of files and directories contained in "dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/system/events".

# In summary, this code is used to retrieve and display the list of all files and directories inside the specified path on DBFS in a Databricks notebook.




files = dbutils.fs.ls("dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/system/events")
display(files)

# COMMAND ----------

# The provided SQL code is designed to select and retrieve all the columns and rows from a specific table stored within a Delta Lake. Here's a breakdown:

# SELECT *: This command tells the SQL engine to retrieve all columns available in the target table or view. The asterisk * is a wildcard symbol that stands for all columns.

# FROM delta.: This indicates that the table or data being queried is stored within a Delta Lake architecture. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Sparkâ„¢ and big data workloads. The delta. prefix specifies that the query should utilize Delta Lake's format and capabilities.

# dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/system/events: This is the path to the specific table or Delta Lake data location. Let's break it down:

# dbfs: stands for Databricks File System. DBFS is a distributed file system installed on Databricks clusters. This allows easy and scalable storage of files in a cloud environment.
# /mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore: This is the directory structure in DBFS where the data is stored. It seems to be structured to indicate a demonstration (demo) for a Delta Lake (dlt) application focused on a bookstore.
# /system/events: This likely refers to a special table or set of data within the Delta Lake that captures system events or logs related to the demo bookstore application. Delta Lake has a feature to keep track of operations (like transactions, updates, deletes, etc.) in an event log for better data management and auditing.
# Overall, this code is querying a Delta Lake table within Databricks File System that stores system events for a demo bookstore application, and it retrieves all available data from that table.



%sql
SELECT * FROM delta.`dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/system/events`

# COMMAND ----------

# This Python code snippet is designed to work within a Databricks environment, leveraging Databricks Utilities (dbutils) to interact with the Databricks File System (DBFS). Here's a concise breakdown:

# dbutils.fs.ls(): This command is used to list all files and directories at the specified path within DBFS. The path provided ("dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/tables") seems to be pointing to a demo bookstore's tables located within a mounted storage (perhaps a demonstration dataset for a digital bookstore).

# files = dbutils.fs.ls("[path]"): The output of the ls command, which includes information about each item in the given directory (name, size, and modification date, among others), is assigned to the variable files.

# display(files): This line calls the display() function, which is a Databricks-specific function useful for displaying data in a more readable and interactive format within Databricks notebooks. The display() function showcases the contents of files in a structured manner, allowing users to easily explore the listed files and directories retrieved from the specified path in DBFS.

# Overall, this code snippet is designed to retrieve and display a list of files and directories from a specific location in DBFS, helping users to explore and manage their data stored in Databricks' managed file storage system.


files = dbutils.fs.ls("dbfs:/mnt/demo/dlt/demo_bookstore/tables")
display(files)

# COMMAND ----------

# Your SQL code is executing a simple query to retrieve all records from a table. Here's a breakdown:

# SELECT *: This part tells the database to select all columns from the specified table.
# FROM demo_bookstore_dlt_db.cn_daily_customer_books: This specifies the table you want to select records from. The table is named cn_daily_customer_books, and it resides within the database demo_bookstore_dlt_db.
# In summary, your code is asking the database to return every column and every row from the cn_daily_customer_books table located within the demo_bookstore_dlt_db database.



%sql
SELECT * FROM demo_bookstore_dlt_db.cn_daily_customer_books

# COMMAND ----------

# The SQL code is selecting all columns from the table fr_daily_customer_books in the database demo_bookstore_dlt_db. It will retrieve all rows and columns in this table.

%sql
SELECT * FROM demo_bookstore_dlt_db.fr_daily_customer_books
